# Lab 2 Code

Java Servlets and JSP pages along with relevant HTML, CSS and JavaScript Code for three independent web applications. 

The **first** web application is the one developed in the first lab along with the corresponding Java Servlets. 

The **second** and **third** web applications cover the examples presented in Lecture 5. 

### Note: 

For further development and testing you need to setup **Eclipse** and Apache Tomcat server following the instructions provided in a separate doc (exists in e-class folder 2024-2025) so that you can develop a **Dynamic Web Project** (create the relevant HTML, CSS and JavaScript files in the "webapp" folder as well as the corresponding Java Servlets or JSPs) and then automatically compile and deploy it in the **Apache Tomcat** server, so that you can access the web application main page (including JSPs and Servlets) through a Web Browser.
