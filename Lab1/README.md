# Lab 1 code

HTML CSS and JavaScript code for two Web Pages that are accessible through a **main page** (index.html).

In the **first** web pace both CSS and JavaScript are placed in the same HTML document.

In the **second** web page the HTML code, CSS and JavaScript are place in separate documents. 

In both cases we have focused on the client-side (aka front-end) development.  

The server-side development of the two above pages is covered in the second lab.
